##What Tech Stack Did We Use for Travel App?

Our Map feature utilizes the Mapbox geocoding API to turn user-entered location into geographical coordinates. MongoDB schema objects store our user and trip info, to allow user to easily update and customize their trips, entries, and profiles. React provided our front end and hooks were used for state management, often implementing useEffect to update state post render. We ventured into Material UI for a sleek, customizable library of design options.
